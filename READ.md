Conway's Game Of Life, Java 2d. 

===============================

Controls:

	0 = Randomize Cells
	1 = Spawn Glider
	2 = Spawn Lightweight Ship
	3 = Spawn Blinker
	4 = Spawn Toad
	5 = Spawn Beacon
	T = Trippy Mode On
	Y = Trippy Mode off
	H = CONTROLS
	R = RULES
	SPACE = Reset Grid

Rules :
	1) A cell is either live or dead
	2) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
        3) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
        4) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
        5) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Some bugs exist for sure.
